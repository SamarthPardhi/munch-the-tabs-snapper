# Munch the Tabs Killer: A Web Extension

## Overview
Munch the Tabs Killer is a browser extension that solves the common problem of tab clutter. When you have too many tabs open that are:
- Too important to close
- Not significant enough to bookmark
- Creating clutter that slows your system
- Living for days or weeks in a state of indecision

This extension allows you to quickly save a tab's URL and close it with a simple keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+W), keeping your browser clean and organized.
